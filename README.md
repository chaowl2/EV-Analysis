# Spatial Analysis of Electric Vehicle Adoption in Washington State
**Overview:**
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive spatial analysis of electric vehicle (EV) adoption in Washington State. By leveraging geospatial data, the project seeks to understand the distribution of electric vehicles across different counties, identify factors influencing adoption, and visualize the results through interactive maps and insightful visualizations.

# Some things to look at

**Spatial Distribution:**

What is the overall spatial distribution of electric vehicles in Washington state?
Are there specific counties or regions with higher concentrations of electric vehicles?

**Spatial Clustering:**

Are there spatial clusters of electric vehicles, indicating areas with a higher density of registrations?
Can you identify any hotspots or coldspots in the distribution of electric vehicles?

**Legislative District Analysis:**

Explore if there are spatial patterns in electric vehicle adoption across different legislative districts.
Are there legislative districts where electric vehicle adoption is particularly high or low?
